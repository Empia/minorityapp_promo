DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       llffttpp is a file transfer program that allows sophisticated FTP, HTTP and
       other connections to other hosts. If _s_i_t_e is specified then  lftp  will
       connect  to that site otherwise a connection has to be established with
       the open command.

       llffttpp can handle several file access methods - FTP, FTPS,  HTTP,  HTTPS,
       HFTP,  FISH, SFTP and file (HTTPS and FTPS are only available when lftp
       is compiled with GNU TLS or  OpenSSL  library).  You  can  specify  the
       method  to  use  in  `open  URL' command, e.g. `open http://www.us.ker‐
       nel.org/pub/linux'. HFTP is ftp-over-http-proxy  protocol.  It  can  be
       used   automatically   instead   of   FTP   if   ftp:proxy  is  set  to
       `http://proxy[:port]'. Fish is a protocol working over an  ssh  connec‐
       tion  to a unix account. SFtp is a protocol implemented in SSH2 as SFTP
       subsystem.

       Besides FTP-like protocols, lftp has support for BitTorrent protocol as
       `torrent' command. Seeding is also supported.

       Every  operation  in  llffttpp  is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is
       handled properly and the  operation  is  repeated.  So  if  downloading
       breaks,  it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if FTP
       server does not support the REST command, llffttpp will try to retrieve the
       file from the very beginning until the file is transferred completely.

       llffttpp  has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several com‐
       mands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group  com‐
       mands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are
       executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job  to
       background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which is
       alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'.  Some  com‐
       mands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe
       to external command. Commands can be executed  conditionally  based  on
       termination status of previous command (&&, ||).

       If  you  exit llffttpp before all jobs are not finished yet, llffttpp will move
       itself to nohup mode in background. The same thing happens with a  real
       modem hangup or when you close an xterm.

       llffttpp has built-in mirror which can download or update a whole directory
       tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates
       a  directory  tree  on  server. Mirror can also synchronize directories
       between two remote servers, using FXP if available.

       There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current con‐
       text,  command  `queue'  to queue commands for sequential execution for
       current server, and much more.

       On  startup,  llffttpp  executes  _/_e_t_c_/_l_f_t_p_._c_o_n_f  and  then  _~_/_._l_f_t_p_r_c  and
       _~_/_._l_f_t_p_/_r_c  (or  _~_/_._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_l_f_t_p_/_r_c if _~_/_._l_f_t_p does not exist).  You can
       place aliases and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see  full
       protocol  debug, use `debug' to turn the debug on. Use `debug 3' to see
       only greeting messages and error messages.

       llffttpp has a number of settable variables. You can use `set  -a'  to  see
       all  variables  and  their  values or `set -d' to see list of defaults.
       Variable names can be abbreviated and prefix can be omitted unless  the
       rest becomes ambiguous.

       If  lftp  was  compiled  with  OpenSSL  (configure  --with-openssl)  it
       includes software developed by the  OpenSSL  Project  for  use  in  the
       OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)

       Define  or undefine alias _n_a_m_e. If _v_a_l_u_e is omitted, the alias is unde‐
       fined, else it takes the value _v_a_l_u_e. If no argument is given the  cur‐
       rent aliases are listed.

       The bookmark command controls bookmarks.

       Site names can be used in the _o_p_e_n command directly  as-is  or  in  any
       command that accepts input URLs using the _b_m_:_s_i_t_e_/_p_a_t_h format.

            add <name> [<loc>]   add  current place or given location to book‐

            list                 list bookmarks (default)

       ccaacchhee  [_s_u_b_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]

       The cache command controls local memory cache.  The  following  subcom‐
       mands are recognized:

            stat        print cache status (default)

            on|off      turn on/off caching
            flush       flush cache

            expire _N_x   set  cache  expiration time to _N seconds (_x=s) minutes
                        (_x=m) hours (_x=h) or days (_x=d)

       ccaatt _f_i_l_e_s

       cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout.  (See  also  mmoorree,  zzccaatt  and
       zzmmoorree)

       ccdd rdir

       Change  current  remote  directory.   The  previous remote directory is
       stored as `-'. You can do `cd -' to change  the  directory  back.   The
       previous  directory for each site is also stored on disk, so you can do
       `open site; cd -' even after lftp restart.

       cchhmmoodd _m_o_d_e _f_i_l_e_s

       Change permission mask on remote files. The mode must be an octal  num‐
       ber.

       cclloossee [--aa]

       Close  idle  connections.  By default only with the current server, use
       -a to close all idle connections.

       ccllss [OOPPTTSS] _f_i_l_e_s_._._.

       `cls' tries to retrieve information about specified files  or  directo‐
       ries  and outputs the information according to format options. The dif‐
       ference between `ls' and `cls' is that `ls' requests the server to for‐
       mat file listing, and `cls' formats it itself, after retrieving all the
       needed information.

       ccoommmmaanndd _c_m_d _a_r_g_s_._._.

       execute given command ignoring aliases.

       ddeebbuugg [OOPPTTSS] _l_e_v_e_l|ooffff

       Switch debugging to _l_e_v_e_l or turn it off. Options:

            -o <file> redirect debug output to the file
            -c        show message context
            -p        show PID
            -t        show timestamps

       eecchhoo [--nn] _s_t_r_i_n_g

       Prints (echos) the given string to the display.

       eeddiitt [OOPPTTSS] _f_i_l_e

       Retrieve remote file to a temporary location, run a local editor on  it
       and upload the file back if changed. Options:

            -k        keep the temporary file
            -o <temp> explicit temporary file location

       eevvaall [--ff _f_o_r_m_a_t ] _a_r_g_s_._._.

       without -f it executes given arguments as a command. With -f, arguments
       are transformed into a new command. The format can contain  plain  text
       and placeholders $0...$9 and $@, corresponding to the arguments.

       eexxiitt [bbgg] [ttoopp] [ppaarreenntt] [kkiillll] [_c_o_d_e]

       exit  will  exit  from  lftp  or move to background if there are active
       jobs. If no job is active, _c_o_d_e is passed to operating system as lftp's
       termination  status.  If _c_o_d_e is omitted, the exit code of last command
       is used.

       `exit bg' forces  moving  to  background  when  cmd:move-background  is
       false.   `exit  top'  makes  top  level  `shell' (internal lftp command
       executor) terminate.  `exit parent' terminates the  parent  shell  when
       running  a  nested  script.  `exit kill' kills all numbered jobs before
       exiting. The options can be combined, e.g.  `at 08:00 -- exit top  kill
       &' kills all jobs and makes lftp exit at specified time.

       ffgg

       Alias for `wait'.

       ffiinndd [OOPPTTSS] _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_._._.

       List files in the directory (current directory by default) recursively.
       This can help with servers lacking ls -R support. You can redirect out‐
       put of this command. Options:

            -d _M_D, --max-depth=_M_D   specify maximum scan depth
            -l,    --list           use long listing format

       ffttppccooppyy

       Obsolete. Use one of the following instead:
            get ftp://... -o ftp://...
            get -O ftp://... file1 file2...
            put ftp://...
            mput ftp://.../*
            mget -O ftp://... ftp://.../*
       or  other  combinations  to  get FXP transfer (directly between two FTP
       servers).  lftp would fallback to plain copy (via client) if FXP trans‐
       fer cannot be initiated or ftp:use-fxp is false.

       ggeett [--EE] [--aa] [--cc] [--ee] [--OO _b_a_s_e] _r_f_i_l_e [--oo _l_f_i_l_e] ...

       Retrieve  the  remote  file _r_f_i_l_e and store it as the local file _l_f_i_l_e.
       If -o is omitted, the file is stored to local file named as  base  name
       of  _r_f_i_l_e.  You can get multiple files by specifying multiple instances
       of _r_f_i_l_e (and -o _l_f_i_l_e). Does not expand wildcards, use mmggeett for that.

            -c          continue, reget
            -E          delete source files after successful transfer
            -e          delete target file before the transfer
            -a          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            -O <base>   specifies base directory or URL where files should  be
                        placed

       Examples:

       ggeett11 [_O_P_T_S] _r_f_i_l_e

       Transfer a single file. Options:

            -o <lfile>                  destination file name (default - base‐
                                        name of rfile)
            -c                          continue, reget
            -E                          delete source files  after  successful
                                        transfer
            -a                          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            --source-region=<from-to>   transfer  specified  region  of source
                                        file
            --target-position=<pos>     position in target file to write  data
                                        at

       gglloobb  [_O_P_T_S] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d] _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s

       Glob  given patterns containing metacharacters and pass result to given
       command or return appropriate exit code.

            -f            plain files (default)
            -d            directories
            -a            all types
            --exist       return zero exit code when the patterns expand to non-empty list
            --not-exist   return zero exit code when the patterns expand to an empty list

       Examples:
            glob echo *
            glob --exist *.csv && echo "There are *.csv files"

       hheellpp [_c_m_d]

       commands.

       jjoobbss [_O_P_T_S] [_j_o_b___n_o_._._.]

       List  running  jobs.  If _j_o_b___n_o is specified, only list a job with that
       number.  Options:

            -v   verbose, several -v increase verbosity
            -r   list just one specified job without recursion

       kkiillll all|_j_o_b___n_o

       Delete specified job with _j_o_b___n_o or all jobs.  (For _j_o_b___n_o see jjoobbss)

       llccdd _l_d_i_r

       Change current local directory _l_d_i_r. The previous  local  directory  is
       stored as `-'. You can do `lcd -' to change the directory back.

       llnn [--ss] _e_x_i_s_t_i_n_g_-_f_i_l_e _n_e_w_-_l_i_n_k

       Make  a hard/symbolic link to an existing file.  Option -s selects cre‐
       ation of a symbolic link.

       llooccaall _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

       Run specified command with local directory file:// session  instead  of
       remote session. Examples:
            local pwd
            local ls
            local mirror /dir1 /dir2

       llppwwdd

       Print current working directory on local machine.

       llss _p_a_r_a_m_s

       List  remote  files. You can redirect output of this command to file or

       When using -R, the source directory is local and the target is  remote.
       If  the  target directory is omitted, base name of the source directory
       is used.  If both directories are omitted,  current  local  and  remote
       directories  are  used.   If  the  target  directory  ends with a slash
       (except the root directory) then base name of the source  directory  is
       appended.

       _R_X is an extended regular expression, just like in eeggrreepp(1).

       _G_P is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.

       Include  and  exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means
       that a file or directory would be mirrored if it matches an include and
       does  not  match  to excludes after the include, or does not match any‐
       thing and the first check is exclude. Directories are  matched  with  a
       slash appended.

       Note  that  symbolic  links  are  not  created when uploading to remote
       server, because FTP protocol cannot do it. To upload  files  the  links
       refer to, use `mirror -RL' command (treat symbolic links as files).

       For options --newer-than and --older-than you can either specify a file
       or  time  specification  like  that  used  by   aatt(1)   command,   e.g.
       `now-7days'  or  `week  ago'.  If you specify a file, then modification
       time of that file will be used.

       Verbosity level can be selected using --verbose=level option or by sev‐
       eral -v options, e.g. -vvv. Levels are:
            0 - no output (default)
            1 - print actions
            2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
            3 - +print directory names which are mirrored

       --only-newer  turns off file size comparison and uploads/downloads only
       newer files even if size is  different.  By  default  older  files  are
       transferred and replace newer ones.

       --upload-older  allows  replacing  newer  remote  files with older ones
       (when the target side is remote). Some remote back-ends cannot preserve
       timestamps so the default is to keep newer files.

       Recursion  mode  can  be  one of `always', `never', `missing', `newer'.
       With the option `newer' mirror compares timestamps of  directories  and
       enters  a  directory only if it is older or missing on the target side.
       Be aware that when a file changes the directory timestamp may stay  the
       same, so mirror won't process that directory.

       You  can  mirror  between  two  servers  if you specify URLs instead of
       directories.  FXP is  automatically  used  for  transfers  between  FTP
       servers, if possible.

       Some  FTP  servers hide dot-files by default (e.g. _._h_t_a_c_c_e_s_s), and show
       them only when LIST command is used with -a option. In such case try to
       use `set ftp:list-options -a'.

       qquueeuuee [--nn _n_u_m ] _c_m_d

       Add the given command to queue for sequential execution. Each site  has
       its  own  queue.  `-n'  adds  the  command before the given item in the
       queue. Don't try to queue `cd' or `lcd' commands, it may confuse  lftp.
       Instead  do the cd/lcd before `queue' command, and it will remember the
       place in which the command is to be done. It is possible to queue up an
       already  running job by `queue wait <jobno>', but the job will continue
       execution even if it is not the first in queue.

       `queue stop' will stop the queue, it will not execute any new commands,
       but already running jobs will continue to run. You can use `queue stop'
       to create an empty stopped queue. `queue start' will resume queue  exe‐
       cution.  When you exit lftp, it will start all stopped queues automati‐
       cally.

       `queue' with no arguments will either create a stopped queue  or  print
       queue status.

                 --delete.

       Examples:
            > get file &
            [1] get file
            > queue wait 1
            > queue get another_file
            > cd a_directory
            > queue get yet_another_file

            queue -d 3             Delete the third item in the queue.
            queue -m 6 4           Move the sixth item in the queue before the
                                   fourth.
            queue -m "get*zip" 1   Move all commands matching "get*zip" to the
                                   beginning of the queue.  (The order of  the
                                   items is preserved.)
            queue -d "get*zip"     Delete all commands matching "get*zip".

       For  FTP  -  send  the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can
       lead to unknown remote state and thus will cause reconnect. You  cannot
       be  sure  that  any change of remote state because of quoted command is
       solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.

       For  HTTP  -  specific  to  HTTP  action.  Syntax:  ``quote   <command>
       [<args>]''.  Command may be ``set-cookie'' or ``post''.
            open http://www.site.net
            quote set-cookie "variable=value; othervar=othervalue"
            set http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
            quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi "var=value&othervar=othervalue" > local_file

       For  FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be used to execute
       arbitrary commands on server. The command must not take input or  print
       ###  at new line beginning. If it does, the protocol will become out of
       sync.
            open fish://server
            quote find -name \*.zip

       rrmm [--rr] [--ff] _f_i_l_e_s

       Remove  remote  files.  Does not expand wildcards, use mmrrmm for that. -r
       is for recursive directory remove. Be careful, if something goes  wrong
       you can lose files. -f suppress error messages.

       rrmmddiirr _d_i_r_(_s_)

       Remove remote directories.

       sseett [_v_a_r [_v_a_l]]

       Set  variable  to given value. If the value is omitted, unset the vari‐
       able.  Variable name has format  ``name/closure'',  where  closure  can
       specify  exact  application  of the setting. See below for details.  If
       set is called with no variable then only altered settings  are  listed.
       It can be changed by options:

            -a   list all settings, including default values
            -d   list only default values, not necessary current ones

       ssiittee _s_i_t_e___c_m_d

       Execute  site command _s_i_t_e___c_m_d and output the result.  You can redirect
       its output.

       sslleeeepp _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l

       Sleep given time interval and exit. Interval is in seconds by  default,
       but  can  be  suffixed  with  'm', 'h', 'd' for minutes, hours and days
       respectively.  See also aatt.

       sslloott [_n_a_m_e]

       Select specified slot or list all slots allocated. A slot is a  connec‐
       tion  to a server, somewhat like a virtual console. You can create mul‐
       tiple slots connected to different servers and switch between them. You
       can  also  use  _s_l_o_t_:_n_a_m_e as a pseudo-URL evaluating to that slot loca‐
       tion.

       Default readline binding allows quick switching between slots named 0-9
       using Meta-0 - Meta-9 keys (often you can use Alt instead of Meta).

       `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see  full  protocol  debug,
       use `debug' to turn the debug on.

       There  is also a system-wide startup file in _/_e_t_c_/_l_f_t_p_._c_o_n_f.  It can be
       in different directory, see FILES section.

              minal  when  moving to background, it is possible to attach back
              using `attach' command; when false, lftp  tricks  the  shell  to
              move lftp to background process group and continues to run, then
              fg shell command brings lftp back to foreground  unless  it  has
              done all jobs and terminated.

              mands. Note that setting this to a value greater than 1  changes
              conditional  execution  behaviour,  basically makes it inconsis‐
              tent.

       ccmmdd::qquueeuuee--ppaarraalllleell (number)
              Number of jobs run in parallel in a queue.

       ccmmdd::rreemmoottee--ccoommpplleettiioonn (boolean)
              a boolean to control whether or not lftp uses remote completion.
              When true, TTaabb key guesses if the word being completed should be
              a remote file name. MMeettaa--TTaabb does remote completion  always.  So
              you  can  force remote completion with MMeettaa--TTaabb when ccmmdd::rreemmoottee--
              ccoommpplleettiioonn is false or when the guess is wrong.

              to do ``cd -'' after lftp restart. Default is true.

       ccmmdd::ssaavvee--rrll--hhiissttoorryy (boolean)
              when    true,     lftp     saves     readline     history     to
              _~_/_._l_o_c_a_l_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_l_f_t_p_/_r_l___h_i_s_t_o_r_y  or  _~_/_._l_f_t_p_/_r_l___h_i_s_t_o_r_y  on exit.
              Default is true.

       ccmmdd::sshhooww--ssttaattuuss (booleam)
              when false, lftp does not show status line on terminal.  Default
              is true.

       ccmmdd::sseett--tteerrmm--ssttaattuuss (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  updates  terminal  status  if supported (e.g.
              xterm). The closure for this setting is the terminal  type  from
              TERM environment variable.

       ccmmdd::ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall (timeiinntteerrvvaall))
              the time interval between status updates.

       ccmmdd::ssttiiffllee--rrll--hhiissttoorryy (number)
              the number of lines to keep in readline history.

       ccmmdd::tteerrmm--ssttaattuuss (string)
              the format string to use to display terminal status. The closure
              for this setting is the  terminal  type  from  TERM  environment
              variable. Default uses ``tsl'' and ``fsl'' termcap values.

              The following escapes are supported:

                   \a   bell
                   \e   escape
                   \n   new line
                   \s   "lftp"
                   \v   lftp version
                   \T   the status string

       ccmmdd::ttiimmee--ssttyyllee (string)
              This setting is the default value for cls --time-style option.

       ccmmdd::ttrraaccee (boolean)
              when true, lftp prints the commands it executes (like sh -x).

       ccmmdd::vveerriiffyy--hhoosstt (boolean)
              if  true, lftp resolves host name immediately in `open' command.
              It is also possible to skip the check for a single  `open'  com‐
              mand if `&' is given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.

       ccmmdd::vveerriiffyy--ppaatthh (boolean)
              if true, lftp checks the path given in `cd' command.  It is also
              possible to skip the check for a single `cd' command if  `&'  is
              given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.  Examples:
                   set cmd:verify-path/hftp://* false
                   cd directory &

       ccmmdd::vveerriiffyy--ppaatthh--ccaacchheedd (boolean)
              When  false,  `cd'  to  a directory known from cache as existent
              will  succeed  immediately.   Otherwise  the  verification  will
              depend on cmd:verify-path setting.

       ccoolloorr::uussee--ccoolloorr (tri-boolean)
              when  true, cls command and completion output colored file list‐
              ings according to color:dir-colors setting.  When set  to  auto,
              colors are used when output is a terminal.

       ccoolloorr::ddiirr--ccoolloorrss (string)
              file  listing color description. By default the value of LS_COL‐
              ORS environment variable is used. See dircolors(1).

       ddnnss::SSRRVV--qquueerryy (boolean)
              query for SRV records and use them before gethostbyname. The SRV
              records  are  only used if port is not explicitly specified. See
              RFC2052 for details.

       ddnnss::ccaacchhee--eennaabbllee (boolean)
              enable DNS cache. If it is off, lftp  resolves  host  name  each
              time it reconnects.

       ddnnss::ccaacchhee--eexxppiirree (time interval)
              time  to  live  for  DNS  cache  entries.  It  has  format <num‐
              ber><unit>+, e.g.  1d12h30m5s or just 36h.  To  disable  expira‐
              tion, set it to `inf' or `never'.

       ddnnss::ccaacchhee--ssiizzee (number)
              maximum number of DNS cache entries.

       ddnnss::ffaattaall--ttiimmeeoouutt (time interval)
              limit the time for DNS queries. If DNS server is unavailable too
              long, lftp will fail to  resolve  a  given  host  name.  Set  to
              `never' to disable.

       ddnnss::oorrddeerr (list of protocol names)
              sets  the  order of DNS queries. Default is ``inet6 inet'' which
              means first look up address in inet6 family, then inet  and  use
              them  in  that  order.  To disable inet6 (AAAA) lookup, set this
              variable to ``inet''.

       ddnnss::uussee--ffoorrkk (boolean)
              if true, lftp will fork before resolving host  address.  Default
              is true.

       ddnnss::mmaaxx--rreettrriieess (number)
              If  zero, there is no limit on the number of times lftp will try
              to lookup an address.  If > 0, lftp will try only this number of
              times to look up an address of each address family in dns:order.

       ffiillee::cchhaarrsseett (string)
              local character set. It is set from current locale initially.

       ffiillee::uussee--lloocckk (boolean)
              when  true, lftp uses advisory locking on local files when open‐
              ing them.

       ffiisshh::aauuttoo--ccoonnffiirrmm (boolean)
              when true, lftp answers ``yes'' to all ssh questions, in partic‐
              ular  to the question about a new host key. Otherwise it answers
              ``no''.

       ffiisshh::cchhaarrsseett (string)
              the character set used by fish server in requests,  replies  and
              file listings.  Default is empty which means the same as local.

       ffiisshh::ccoonnnneecctt--pprrooggrraamm (string)
              the  program  to  use for connecting to remote server. It should
              support `-l' option for user name, `-p' for port number. Default
              is `ssh -a -x'. You can set it to `rsh', for example.

       ffiisshh::sshheellll (string)
              use  specified shell on server side. Default is /bin/sh. On some
              systems, /bin/sh exits when doing cd to  a  non-existent  direc‐
              tory.  lftp  can  handle that but it has to reconnect. Set it to
              /bin/bash for such systems if bash is installed.

       ffttpp::aacccctt (string)
              Send this string in ACCT command  after  login.  The  result  is
              ignored.  The closure for this setting has format _u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t.

       ffttpp::aannoonn--ppaassss (string)
              sets  the password used for anonymous FTP access authentication.
              Default is "lftp@".

       ffttpp::aannoonn--uusseerr (string)
              sets the user name used for anonymous FTP access authentication.
              Default is "anonymous".

       ffttpp::aauuttoo--ssyynncc--mmooddee (regex)
              if  first  server  message matches this regex, turn on sync mode
              for that host.

       ffttpp::ccaattcchh--ssiizzee (boolean)
              when there is no support for SIZE command,  try  to  catch  file
              size from the "150 Opening data connection" reply.

       ffttpp::cchhaarrsseett (string)
              the  character  set  used by FTP server in requests, replies and
              file listings.  Default is empty which means the same as  local.
              This setting is only used when the server does not support UTF8.

       ffttpp::cclliieenntt (string)
              the  name  of FTP client to send with CLNT command, if supported
              by server.  If it is empty, then no CLNT command will be sent.

       ffttpp::bbiinndd--ddaattaa--ssoocckkeett (boolean)
              bind data socket to the interface of control connection (in pas‐
              sive  mode).   Default is true, exception is the loopback inter‐
              face.

       ffttpp::ffiixx--ppaassvv--aaddddrreessss (boolean)
              if true, lftp will try to correct address returned by server for
              PASV  command  in  case when server address is in public network
              and PASV returns an address from a private network. In this case
              lftp would substitute server address instead of the one returned
              by PASV command, port number would not be changed.   Default  is
              true.

       ffttpp::ffxxpp--ppaassssiivvee--ssoouurrccee (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  will try to set up source FTP server in passive
              mode first, otherwise destination one. If first  attempt  fails,
              lftp  tries  to set them up the other way. If the other disposi‐
              tion fails too, lftp falls back to plain copy. See also ftp:use-
              fxp.

       ffttpp::hhoommee (string)
              Initial directory. Default is empty string which means auto. Set
              this to `/' if you don't like the look of %2F in FTP  URLs.  The
              closure for this setting has format _u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t.

       ffttpp::iiggnnoorree--ppaassvv--aaddddrreessss (boolean)
              If true, lftp uses control connection address instead of the one
              returned in PASV reply for data connection. This can  be  useful
              for broken NATs.  Default is false.

       ffttpp::lliisstt--eemmppttyy--ookk (boolean)
              if  set  to false, empty lists from LIST command will be treated
              as incorrect, and another method (NLST) will be used.

       ffttpp::lliisstt--ooppttiioonnss (string)
              sets options which are always appended to LIST command.  It  can
              be  useful to set this to `-a' if server does not show dot (hid‐
              den) files by default.  Default is empty.

       ffttpp::nnoopp--iinntteerrvvaall (seconds)
              delay between NOOP commands when downloading  tail  of  a  file.
              This  is  useful  for FTP servers which send "Transfer complete"
              message before flushing data transfer. In such cases  NOOP  com‐
              mands can prevent connection timeout.

       ffttpp::ppaassssiivvee--mmooddee (boolean)
              sets  passive  FTP  mode. This can be useful if you are behind a
              firewall or a dumb masquerading router.  In  passive  mode  lftp
              uses  PASV command, not the PORT command which is used in active
              mode. In passive mode lftp itself makes the data  connection  to
              the  server; in active mode the server connects to lftp for data
              transfer. Passive mode is the default.

       ffttpp::ppoorrtt--iippvv44 (ipv4 address)
              specifies an IPv4 address to send with PORT command. Default  is
              empty  which  means  to send the address of local end of control
              connection.

       ffttpp::ppoorrtt--rraannggee (from-to)
              allowed port range for  active  mode.   Format  is  min-max,  or
              `full' or `any' to indicate any port. Default is `full'.

       ffttpp::pprreeffeerr--eeppssvv (boolean)
              use EPSV as preferred passive mode. Default is `false'.

       ffttpp::pprrooxxyy (URL)
              specifies  FTP proxy to use.  To disable proxy set this to empty
              string. Note that it is a FTP proxy which uses FTP protocol, not
              FTP  over HTTP. Default value is taken from environment variable
              ffttpp__pprrooxxyy if it  starts  with  ``ftp://''.  If  your  FTP  proxy
              requires  authentication,  specify user name and password in the
              URL.  If ftp:proxy starts with http:// then hftp  protocol  (FTP
              over HTTP proxy) is used instead of FTP automatically.

       ffttpp::pprrooxxyy--aauutthh--ttyyppee (string)
              When  set  to ``joined'', lftp sends ``user@proxy_user@ftp.exam‐
              ple.org'' as user name to proxy, and ``password@proxy_password''
              as password.

              When  set  to ``joined-acct'', lftp sends ``user@ftp.example.org
              proxy_user'' (with space) as user name to proxy. The site  pass‐
              word  is sent as usual and the proxy password is expected in the
              following ACCT command.

              When set to ``open'', lftp first  sends  proxy  user  and  proxy
              password  and  then  ``OPEN ftp.example.org'' followed by ``USER
              user''.  The site password is then sent as usual.

              When set to ``user'' (default), lftp first sends proxy user  and
              proxy  password  and then ``user@ftp.example.org'' as user name.
              The site password is then sent as usual.

              When  set  to  ``proxy-user@host'',  lftp  first  sends   ``USER
              proxy_user@ftp.example.org'', then proxy password. The site user
              and password are then sent as usual.

       ffttpp::rreesstt--lliisstt (boolean)
              allow usage of REST command before LIST command. This  might  be
              useful  for  large  directories,  but  some FTP servers silently
              ignore REST before LIST.

       ffttpp::rreesstt--ssttoorr (boolean)
              if false, lftp will not try to use REST before STOR. This can be
              useful  for  some  buggy servers which corrupt (fill with zeros)
              the file if REST followed by STOR is used.

       ffttpp::rreettrryy--553300 (regex)
              Retry on server reply 530 for PASS command if text matches  this
              regular  expression.   This  setting should be useful to distin‐
              guish between overloaded server (temporary condition) and incor‐
              rect password (permanent condition).

       ffttpp::rreettrryy--553300--aannoonnyymmoouuss (regex)
              Additional   regular   expression   for  anonymous  login,  like
              ftp:retry-530.

       ffttpp::ssiittee--ggrroouupp (string)
              Send this string in SITE GROUP command after login.  The  result
              is ignored.  The closure for this setting has format _u_s_e_r_@_h_o_s_t.

       ffttpp::sskkeeyy--aallllooww (boolean)
              allow  sending  skey/opie reply if server appears to support it.
              On by default.

       ffttpp::sskkeeyy--ffoorrccee (boolean)
              do not send plain text password over the network, use  skey/opie
              instead. If skey/opie is not available, assume failed login. Off
              by default.

       ffttpp::ssssll--aallllooww (boolean)
              if true, try to negotiate SSL connection  with  FTP  server  for
              non-anonymous  access.  Default is true. This and other SSL set‐
              tings are only available if lftp was compiled  with  an  ssl/tls
              library.

       ffttpp::ssssll--aauutthh (string)
              the  argument  for  AUTH command, can be one of SSL, TLS, TLS-P,
              TLS-C.  See RFC4217 for explanations. By default TLS or SSL will
              be used, depending on FEAT reply.

       ffttpp::ssssll--ddaattaa--uussee--kkeeyyss (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp loads ssl:key-file for protected data connection
              too. When false, it does not, and the server can match data  and
              control connections by session ID.  Default is true.

       ffttpp::ssssll--ffoorrccee (boolean)
              if  true,  refuse to send password in clear when server does not
              support SSL.  Default is false.

       ffttpp::ssssll--pprrootteecctt--ddaattaa (boolean)
              if true, request SSL connection for data transfers. This is cpu-
              intensive but provides privacy. Default is false.

       ffttpp::ssssll--pprrootteecctt--ffxxpp (boolean)
              if  true,  request  SSL connection for data transfer between two
              FTP servers in FXP mode. CPSV or SSCN command will  be  used  in
              that  case.  If SSL connection fails for some reason, lftp would
              try unprotected FXP transfer unless ftp:ssl-force is set for any
              of the two servers. Default is false.

       ffttpp::ssssll--pprrootteecctt--lliisstt (boolean)
              if true, request SSL connection for file list transfers. Default
              is true.

       ffttpp::ssssll--uussee--cccccc (boolean)
              if true, lftp would issue CCC command after logon, thus  disable
              ssl protection layer on control connection.

       ffttpp::ssttaatt--iinntteerrvvaall (time interval)
              interval between STAT commands. Default is 1 second.

       ffttpp::ssttrriicctt--mmuullttiilliinnee (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  strictly  checks  for  multiline reply format
              (expects it to end with the same code as it started with).  When
              false, this check is relaxed.

       ffttpp::ssyynncc--mmooddee (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  will  send  one  command at a time and wait for
              response. This might be useful if you  are  using  a  buggy  FTP
              server  or router. When it is off, lftp sends a pack of commands
              and waits for responses - it speeds up operation when round trip
              time  is  significant.   Unfortunately it does not work with all
              FTP servers and some routers have troubles with it, so it is  on
              by default.

       ffttpp::ttiimmeezzoonnee (string)
              Assume  this timezone for time in listings returned by LIST com‐
              mand.  This setting can be GMT offset [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]]  or  any
              valid       TZ       value      (e.g.      Europe/Moscow      or
              MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3). The default is GMT.  Set  it  to  an
              empty  value  to  assume local timezone specified by environment
              variable TZ.

       ffttpp::ttrruusstt--ffeeaatt (string)
              When true, assume that FEAT returned data are correct and  don't
              use common protocol extensions like SIZE, MDTM, REST if they are
              not listed.  Default is false.

       ffttpp::uussee--aabboorr (boolean)
              if false, lftp does not send ABOR command but closes  data  con‐
              nection immediately.

       ffttpp::uussee--aalllloo (boolean)
              when  true (default), lftp sends ALLO command before uploading a
              file.

       ffttpp::uussee--ffeeaatt (boolean)
              when  true  (default),  lftp  uses  FEAT  command  to  determine
              extended features of ftp server.

       ffttpp::uussee--ffxxpp (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp will try to set up direct connection between two
              ftp servers.

       ffttpp::uussee--hhffttpp (boolean)
              when ftp:proxy points to an http  proxy,  this  setting  selects
              hftp  method  (GET,  HEAD)  when  true,  and CONNECT method when
              false. Default is true.

       ffttpp::uussee--iipp--ttooss (boolean)
              when true, lftp uses IPTOS_LOWDELAY for control  connection  and
              IPTOS_THROUGHPUT for data connections.

       ffttpp::llaanngg (boolean)
              the  language  selected with LANG command, if supported as indi‐
              cated by FEAT response. Default  is  empty  which  means  server
              default.

       ffttpp::uussee--mmddttmm (boolean)
              when  true  (default),  lftp uses MDTM command to determine file
              modification time.

       ffttpp::uussee--mmddttmm--oovveerrllooaaddeedd (boolean)
              when true, lftp uses two argument MDTM command to set file modi‐
              fication time on uploaded files. Default is false.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssiittee--iiddllee (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  sends `SITE IDLE' command with net:idle argu‐
              ment. Default is false.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssiittee--uuttiimmee (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends 5-argument `SITE  UTIME'  command  to  set
              file modification time on uploaded files. Default is true.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssiittee--uuttiimmee22 (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  sends  2-argument `SITE UTIME' command to set
              file modification time on uploaded files. Default is  true.   If
              5-argument  `SITE  UTIME' is also enabled, 2-argument command is
              tried first.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssiizzee (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses SIZE command  to  determine  file
              size.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssttaatt (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  sends STAT command in FXP mode transfer to know
              how much data has been transferred. See also  ftp:stat-interval.
              Default is true.

       ffttpp::uussee--ssttaatt--ffoorr--lliisstt (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  uses STAT instead of LIST command. By default
              `.' is used as STAT argument. Using STAT, lftp  avoids  creating
              data connection for directory listing. Some servers require spe‐
              cial options for STAT,  use  ftp:list-options  to  specify  them
              (e.g. --llaa).

       ffttpp::uussee--tteellnneett--iiaacc (boolean)
              when  true  (default),  lftp uses TELNET IAC command and follows
              TELNET protocol as specified in RFC959. When false, it does  not
              follow TELNET protocol and thus does not double 255 (0xFF, 0377)
              character and does not prefix ABOR and STAT commands with TELNET
              IP+SYNCH signal.

       ffttpp::uussee--ttvvffss (tri-boolean)
              When  set  to auto, usage of TVFS feature depends on FEAT server
              reply. Otherwise this setting tells whether use it  or  not.  In
              short,  if a server supports TVFS feature then it uses unix-like
              paths.

       ffttpp::uussee--uuttff88 (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends `OPTS UTF8 ON' to  the  server  to  activate
              UTF-8 encoding (if supported). Disable it if the file names have
              a different encoding and the server has a trouble with it.

       ffttpp::uussee--qquuiitt (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends QUIT before disconnecting from  ftp  server.
              Default is true.

       ffttpp::vveerriiffyy--aaddddrreessss (boolean)
              verify  that  data  connection comes from the network address of
              control connection peer. This can possibly prevent data  connec‐
              tion  spoofing which can lead to data corruption. Unfortunately,
              this can fail for  certain  ftp  servers  with  several  network
              interfaces,  when  they  do  not  set  outgoing  address on data
              socket, so it is disabled by default.

       ffttpp::vveerriiffyy--ppoorrtt (boolean)
              verify that data connection has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote
              end.   This  can  possibly  prevent  data connection spoofing by
              users of remote host. Unfortunately, too many windows  and  even
              unix  ftp  servers forget to set proper port on data connection,
              thus this check is off by default.

       ffttpp::wweebb--mmooddee (boolean)
              disconnect after closing data connection. This can be useful for
              totally broken ftp servers. Default is false.

       ffttppss::iinniittiiaall--pprroott (string)
              specifies  initial  PROT setting for FTPS connections. Should be
              one of: C, S, E, P, or  empty.  Default  is  empty  which  means
              unknown,  so that lftp will use PROT command unconditionally. If
              PROT command turns out to be unsupported, then Clear mode  would
              be assumed.

       hhffttpp::ccaacchhee (boolean)
              allow server/proxy side caching for ftp-over-http protocol.

       hhffttpp::ccaacchhee--ccoonnttrrooll (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request header.

       hhffttpp::ddeeccooddee (boolean)
              when  true, lftp automatically decodes the entity in hftp proto‐
              col when Content-Encoding header value  matches  deflate,  gzip,
              compress, x-gzip or x-compress.

       hhffttpp::pprrooxxyy (URL)
              specifies HTTP proxy for FTP-over-HTTP protocol (hftp). The pro‐
              tocol hftp cannot work without a HTTP proxy, obviously.  Default
              value  is taken from environment variable ffttpp__pprrooxxyy if it starts
              with   ``http://'',   otherwise   from   environment    variable
              hhttttpp__pprrooxxyy.   If your FTP proxy requires authentication, specify
              user name and password in the URL.

       hhffttpp::uussee--aallllpprroopp (boolean)
              if true, lftp will send `<allprop/>' request body in  `PROPFIND'
              requests, otherwise it will send an empty request body.

       hhffttpp::uussee--aauutthhoorriizzaattiioonn (boolean)
              if  set  to  off,  lftp will send password as part of URL to the
              proxy. This may be required  for  some  proxies  (e.g.  M-soft).
              Default is on, and lftp will send password as part of Authoriza‐
              tion header.

       hhffttpp::uussee--hheeaadd (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will try to use `GET' instead of `HEAD'  for
              hftp  protocol.  While this is slower, it may allow lftp to work
              with some proxies which don't  understand  or  mishandle  ``HEAD
              ftp://'' requests.

       hhffttpp::uussee--mmkkccooll (boolean)
              if  set to off, lftp will try to use `PUT' instead of `MKCOL' to
              create directories with hftp protocol. Default is off.

       hhffttpp::uussee--pprrooppffiinndd (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will not try to use `PROPFIND' to get direc‐
              tory  contents with hftp protocol and use `GET' instead. Default
              is off.

       hhffttpp::uussee--ttyyppee (boolean)
              If set to off, lftp won't try to append `;type=' to URLs  passed
              to  proxy.   Some  broken  proxies  don't  handle  it correctly.
              Default is on.

       hhttttpp::aacccceepptt,,  hhttttpp::aacccceepptt--cchhaarrsseett,,  hhttttpp::aacccceepptt--eennccooddiinngg,,  hhttttpp::aacccceepptt--

              specify corresponding HTTP request headers.

       hhttttpp::aauutthhoorriizzaattiioonn (string)
              the  authorization to use by default, when no user is specified.
              The format is ``user:password''. Default is empty which means no
              authorization.

       hhttttpp::ccaacchhee (boolean)
              allow server/proxy side caching.

       hhttttpp::ccaacchhee--ccoonnttrrooll (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request header.

       hhttttpp::ccooookkiiee (string)
              send this cookie to server. A closure is useful here:
                   set cookie/www.somehost.com "param=value"

       hhttttpp::ddeeccooddee (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp automatically decodes the entity when Content-
              Encoding header value matches deflate, gzip, compress, x-gzip or
              x-compress.

       hhttttpp::ppoosstt--ccoonntteenntt--ttyyppee (string)
              specifies  value  of  Content-Type  HTTP request header for POST
              method.  Default is ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded''.

       hhttttpp::pprrooxxyy (URL)
              specifies HTTP proxy. It is used when lftp works over HTTP  pro‐
              tocol.    Default  value  is  taken  from  environment  variable
              hhttttpp__pprrooxxyy.  If your proxy requires authentication, specify user
              name and password in the URL.

       hhttttpp::ppuutt--mmeetthhoodd (PUT or POST)
              specifies which HTTP method to use on put.

       hhttttpp::ppuutt--ccoonntteenntt--ttyyppee (string)
              specifies  value  of  Content-Type  HTTP  request header for PUT
              method.

       hhttttpp::rreeffeerreerr (string)
              specifies value for Referer HTTP request header. Single dot  `.'
              expands  to  current directory URL. Default is `.'. Set to empty
              string to disable Referer header.

       hhttttpp::sseett--ccooookkiieess (boolean)
              if true, lftp modifies  http:cookie  variables  when  Set-Cookie
              header is received.

       hhttttpp::uussee--aallllpprroopp (boolean)
              if  true, lftp will send `<allprop/>' request body in `PROPFIND'

       hhttttpp::uussee--mmkkccooll (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will try to use `PUT' instead of `MKCOL'  to
              create directories with HTTP protocol. Default is on.

              specifies order of file transfers. Valid values are: name, name-
              desc,  size,  size-desc, date, date-desc. When the value is name
              or name-desc, then mirror:order setting also affects  the  order
              or transfers.

       mmiirrrroorr::oorrddeerr (list of patterns)
              specifies  order  of  file  transfers when sorting by name. E.g.
              setting this to "*.sfv *.sum" makes  mirror  to  transfer  files
              matching  *.sfv  first,  then  ones  matching *.sum and then all
              other files. To process directories after other files, add  "*/"

              if true, mirror will start processing of several directories  in
              parallel  when it is in parallel mode. Otherwise, it will trans‐
              fer files from a single directory before moving to other  direc‐
              tories.

       mmiirrrroorr::ppaarraalllleell--ttrraannssffeerr--ccoouunntt (number)

              permissions.  You can override it by --perms option. Default  is
              on.

       mmiirrrroorr::sskkiipp--nnooaacccceessss (boolean)
              when true, mirror does not try to download files which are obvi‐
              ously inaccessible by the permission mask. Default is false.

       mmiirrrroorr::uussee--ppggeett--nn (number)
              specifies -n option for pget command used to transfer every sin‐

              if true, foreground connections have  priority  over  background
              ones  and can interrupt background transfers to complete a fore‐
              ground operation.

       nneett::iiddllee (time interval)
              disconnect from server after this idle time. Default is  3  min‐
              utes.

              limit  transfer  rate on data connection. 0 means unlimited. You
              can specify two numbers separated by colon to limit download and
              upload rate separately.  Suffixes are supported, e.g. 100K means
              102400.

              limit  transfer  rate  of all connections in sum. 0 means unlim‐
              ited. You can specify two numbers separated by  colon  to  limit
              download  and  upload  rate  separately.  Note that sockets have
              receive buffers on them, this can  lead  to  network  link  load
              higher  than  this rate limit just after transfer beginning. You
              can try to set net:socket-buffer to relatively  small  value  to
              avoid this.

       nneett::lliimmiitt--ttoottaall--mmaaxx (bytes)

              multiplication by net:reconnect-interval-multiplier reaches this
              value (or exceeds it), it is reset back to  net:reconnect-inter‐
              val-base.

       nneett::rreeccoonnnneecctt--iinntteerrvvaall--mmuullttiipplliieerr (real number)
              sets  multiplier  by which base interval is multiplied each time
              new attempt to perform an operation  fails.  When  the  interval

              suggested filenames provided by the  server  are  used  if  user
              explicitly  sets  this option to `on'. As this could be security
              risk, default is off.

       xxffeerr::cclloobbbbeerr (boolean)
              if this setting is off, get commands will not overwrite existing
              files and generate an error instead.

       xxffeerr::ddeessttiinnaattiioonn--ddiirreeccttoorryy (path or URL to directory)
              This  setting is used as default -O option for get and mget com‐
              mands.  Default is empty, which means current directory  (no  -O
              option).

       xxffeerr::ddiisskk--ffuullll--ffaattaall (boolean)
              when true, lftp aborts a transfer if it cannot write target file
              because of full disk or quota; when false, lftp waits  for  disk
              space to be freed.

       xxffeerr::lloogg (boolean)
              when true, lftp logs transfers to a file from xfer:log-file set‐
              ting.

       xxffeerr::lloogg--ffiillee (path to file)
              the     file     to     log    transfers    to.    Default    is
              _~_/_._l_o_c_a_l_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_l_f_t_p_/_t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r___l_o_g or _~_/_._l_f_t_p_/_t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r___l_o_g.

       xxffeerr::mmaakkee--bbaacckkuupp (boolean)
              when true, lftp renames pre-existing file  adding  ``~''  suffix
              instead of overwriting it.

       xxffeerr::mmaaxx--lloogg--ssiizzee (number)
              maximum size of the transfer log file. When the size is reached,
              the file is renamed and started anew.

       xxffeerr::mmaaxx--rreeddiirreeccttiioonnss (number)
              maximum number of redirections. This can be useful for download‐
              ing over HTTP.  0 prohibits redirections.

              temporary file name pattern, first asterisk is replaced  by  the
              original file name.

       xxffeerr::uussee--tteemmpp--ffiillee (boolean)
              when true, a file will be transferred to a temporary file in the
              same directory and then renamed.

       xxffeerr::vveerriiffyy (boolean)
              when true, verify-command is launched after successful  transfer
              to  validate  file  integrity.  Zero  exit  code of that command
              should indicate correctness of the file.

       xxffeerr::vveerriiffyy--ccoommmmaanndd (string)
              the command to validate file integrity. The only argument is the
              path to the file.

       The  name of a variable can be abbreviated unless it becomes ambiguous.
       The prefix before `:' can be omitted too. You can set one variable sev‐
       eral  times  for  different closures, and thus you can get a particular
       settings for particular state. The closure is  to  be  specified  after
       variable name separated with slash `/'.

       The  closure  for `dns:', `net:', `ftp:', `http:', `hftp:' domain vari‐
       ables is currently just the host name as you specify it in  the  `open'
       command  (with  some  exceptions  where  closure  is  meaningless, e.g.
       dns:cache-size).  For some `cmd:' domain variables the closure is  cur‐
       rent  URL  without path.  For other variables it is not currently used.
       See examples in the sample _l_f_t_p_._c_o_n_f.

       Certain commands and settings take a time interval  parameter.  It  has
       the  format Nx[Nx...], where N is time amount (floating point) and x is
       time unit: d - days, h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default  unit
       is  second.  E.g.  5h30m or 5.5h.  Also the interval can be `infinity',
       `inf', `never', `forever' - it means  infinite  interval.  E.g.  `sleep
       forever' or `set dns:cache-expire never'.

       Boolean  settings  can be one of (true, on, yes, 1, +) for a True value
       or one of (false, off, no, 0, -) for a False value.

       Tri-boolean settings have either a boolean value or `auto'.

       Integer settings can have a suffix: k - kibi, m - mebi, g - gigi,  etc.
       They can also have a prefix: 0 - octal, 0x - hexadecimal.

   FFTTPP aassyynncchhrroonnoouuss mmooddee ((ppiippeelliinniinngg))
       LLffttpp  can  speed  up FTP operations by sending several commands at once
       and then checking all the responses. See ftp:sync-mode variable.  Some‐
       times this does not work, thus synchronous mode is the default. You can
       try to turn synchronous mode off and see if it works  for  you.  It  is
       known that some network software dealing with address translation works
       incorrectly in the case of several FTP commands in one network packet.

       RFC959 says: ``The user-process sending another command before the com‐
       pletion  reply  would  be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP pro‐
       cesses should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding  command
       is  in  progress''.  Also, RFC1123 says: ``Implementors MUST NOT assume
       any correspondence between READ boundaries on  the  control  connection
       and  the  Telnet  EOL sequences (CR LF).'' and ``a single READ from the
       control connection may include more than one FTP command''.

       So it must be safe to send several commands at once,  which  speeds  up
       operation  a  lot  and  seems  to  work with all Unix and VMS based ftp
       servers. Unfortunately, windows based servers often cannot handle  sev‐
       eral commands in one packet, and so cannot some broken routers.
