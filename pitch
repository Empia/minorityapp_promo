Hello my name is Stanislav 
I'm a technical cofounder of Minority
The other cofounder can't be here right now, he is in hospital
So I decided to make this video early because we achieved general milestone
It's one thousands registered users with 70% Daily active 

So the product
  The product helps people construct and run throught their daily activities( in a form of steps) construction happens either by 
human either by robot by AI

Market/Problem
  Primary idea comes from the problem that  in multiple companies that we are worked for
 there is always mess in planning activities. of course they using task and project managment tools but problem is more deeply within
 They are stuck in a task based way of thinking
  projects not about task they are about interaction and interfaces
  they are about commitments and communication

 Existing solution do not represent reality(they represent thoughts, when action strating they are changing a lot and being forgottten)
 Task are not clear enough(task have states but they are not provide deep conversation, therefore lots of emails and so on)
 Reality it's all about solution, all about to search solution in future and when you found it you can recreacre in your futher work 


Conclusion
 Thats it for now, oh and one request if it's possible
Please if you spent time to research this application and product please give short feedback on that
It's more meaningfull then a sorry you are promising but not a winner and we doesnt select you  
Bye
